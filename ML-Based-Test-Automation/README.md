# ML-Based Test Automation

An intelligent test automation framework leveraging machine learning to predict test failures, optimize test execution, and improve overall testing efficiency.

## Features

- **Predictive Test Case Failure Analysis**: ML models that predict potential test case failures, reducing redundant executions and improving test efficiency.
- **Optimized Test Execution Sequences**: Intelligent scheduling algorithm to prioritize test cases based on failure probability and execution impact.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Analysis of historical test results and logs to extract meaningful patterns and improve overall test strategy.
- **Feature Engineering for Test Optimization**: Engineering relevant features from test logs, execution times, and code changes to enhance model accuracy.
- **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**: ML-powered test automation integrated into CI/CD workflows for faster feedback loops and continuous quality assurance.
- **Automated Root Cause Analysis**: ML techniques to classify and diagnose test failures, reducing manual debugging efforts.
- **Scalable and Adaptive Framework**: A scalable framework that adapts to evolving test environments and dynamically adjusts testing strategies.
- **Performance and Accuracy Metrics**: Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable test failure predictions.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ML-Based-Test-Automation.git
