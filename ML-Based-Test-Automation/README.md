## Project Status

🏗️ **Currently in Development**

- ✅ **Phase 1: Project Setup** - Completed *(GitHub repository, directory structure, configuration files)*
- ✅ **Phase 2: Data Handling & Processing** - Completed *(Data collection, preprocessing, exploratory analysis)*
- ✅ **Phase 3: Feature Engineering** - Completed *(Feature extraction, selection, and optimization)*
- 🚧 **Phase 4: Model Development** - Pending
- 🚧 **Phase 5: Test Optimization Framework** - Pending
- 🚧 **Phase 6: Integration & Deployment** - Pending

## Features

- **Predictive Test Case Failure Analysis**: ML models that predict potential test case failures, reducing redundant executions and improving test efficiency.
- **Optimized Test Execution Sequences**: Intelligent scheduling algorithm to prioritize test cases based on failure probability and execution impact.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Analysis of historical test results and logs to extract meaningful patterns and improve overall test strategy.
- **Feature Engineering for Test Optimization**: Engineering relevant features from test logs, execution times, and code changes to enhance model accuracy.
- **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**: ML-powered test automation integrated into CI/CD workflows for faster feedback loops and continuous quality assurance.
- **Automated Root Cause Analysis**: ML techniques to classify and diagnose test failures, reducing manual debugging efforts.
- **Scalable and Adaptive Framework**: A scalable framework that adapts to evolving test environments and dynamically adjusts testing strategies.
- **Performance and Accuracy Metrics**: Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable test failure predictions.

## Implementation Details

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ML-Based-Test-Automation.git
   cd ML-Based-Test-Automation
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the data sources in `config.py`

5. Run the initial data collection:
   ```
   python src/data/collect_data.py
   ```
